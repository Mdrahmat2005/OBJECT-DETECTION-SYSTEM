 Object Detection System

This project is a simple Object Detection System that detects and identifies objects in images or video streams. It uses computer vision and deep learning to draw bounding boxes around detected objects and can also provide voice feedback for detected objects.

The project is beginner-friendly and designed for learning purposes, while still demonstrating real-world object detection concepts.
